# Breath of the Wild - Mod Manager

## Overview

Breath of the Wild Mod Manager aims to be an easy-to-use mod manager that will make all of the great BotW modding tools easier to use & access.

Currently, it's just me working with some concepts. Here are some of the more defined ideas for BotW Mod Manager.

- A UI for _all_ BotW console tools.
- First mod walkthrough.
- In-App tutorials. (Might be restricted due to creator license.)
- Automating repetitive tasks.
- Installers for all external tools. (Silent Princess, Switch-ToolBox, BotW-Actor-Tool, Wildbits, etc.)
- Easy actor creation.
- Shrine Builder (Might be part of SP already)

## Platform

UI release: Windows (Maybe Linux)

Console release: Windows, Linux (Maybe MacOS)

## Alpha Testing

If you want to test BMM, first copy the GitHub Repo in Visual Studio and then run either the **Mod Manager UI** or **SW_SimpleMsytEditor**

Nothing does anything right now, but you can look at the UI I've put together.
