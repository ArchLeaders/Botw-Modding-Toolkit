# Breath of the Wild - **M**odding **T**ool**k**it

Breath of the Wild Mod Manager aims to be an easy-to-use mod manager that will make all of the great BotW modding tools easier to use & access.

Currently, it's just me working with some concepts. Here are some of the more defined ideas for MTK.

- A UI for _all_ BotW console tools.
- First mod walkthrough to get started faster.
- In-App tutorials. (Might be restricted due to creator license.)
- Automating repetitive tasks.
- Installers for all external tools. (Silent Princess (When released), Switch-ToolBox, BotW-Actor-Tool, Wildbits, etc.)
- Easy actor creation.
- Shrine Builder (Might be part of SP already)

## MTK Commander

Simple command-line tool for speeding up the process of making mods.

To use MTK, run the installer and fill out the required fields, once installed type `mtk.exe` in a new mod folder (just a folder named whatever you want your mod to be named, not a content/aoc structure).

A help message with every command will be printed when started.

### Primary Features

Quickly start a new mod with the **create** command. (Mostly working, but not extensively tested.)

Build structure actors in seconds using the **actor** command.

Debug mods quicker with the **bnp** command.
